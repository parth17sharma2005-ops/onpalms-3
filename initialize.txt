There are files in this folder, from an old project that I scrapped. I am building
a new one, fresh. The main logic is using RAG, first chunk and embed data from the
word press URL 
https://www.onpalms.com/wp-json/wp/v2/pages?per_page=100
https://www.onpalms.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?per_page=100,
 and then 
retrieve the data so my bot learns about the website. the bot is basically to help website
users get to know the company better and take their info "name and business mail".
I am building this project for easier deployment. I have AWS membership. 
I want the name and business mail to be stored either in a database, or a 
google sheet for easy access. Main function is to take data. the footer.php file is
where the chatbot's frontend is at. it is a popup, at the bottom right corner of the 
website. lets build and deploy this project, so i can paste the API url in footer.php
and make the bot complete. the frontend is currently deployed. but the backend isnt deployed yet.
